# My Personal Project:

## 2048 Game

**What will the project do?**

A game where the goal is to combine numbers randomly appearing on a grid until you have reached a 
goal (Usually the number 2048) or when you have no more possible moves to make.

**Rules:**
- Maximum of four possible moves per turn. left, right, up down.
    - any of these four moves shifts all numbers in the corresponding directions skipping over all empty space
    - any identical numbers adjacent in the axis of movement or separated by empty space will be combined with their values 
    added together.
    - every move a 2 or 4 will spawn randomly in one of the empty grid spaces.
- Game ends when there are no possible moves to make or when there are no empty spaces and no adjacent values.

**Who will use it?**

Anyone looking to play a relaxing easy to play game.

**Why is this project of interest to me?**

I have played this game before and am interested in what it would take to make. It seems like a fun project to complete.
